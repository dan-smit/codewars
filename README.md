# How It's Made

**Tech used: JavaScript**

Everyday I solve a codewars challenge!

## Optimizations

I consistently optimize my code by learning and implementing solutions that improve efficiency and readability.

## Lessons Learned

The biggest lesson I have learned is that codewars is a marathon, not a sprint. I will be the best software developer I can be by learning as best as I can, and that is done by taking the initiative to learn and consistently writing code.
